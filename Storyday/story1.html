                <p style="font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">  once
                    upon a time - Buddhist monks were on a
                    journey one of them was the senior monk
                    and the other was a junior monk and
                    during their journey they approached a
                    raging river and on the
                    riverbank stood
                    a young lady she was clearly concerned
                    about how she would get to the other
                    side of the river without drowning the
                    junior monk walked straight past her
                    without giving it a thought and he
                    crossed the river the senior monk
                    however picked up the woman and carried
                    her across the river he placed her down
                    they parted ways and on they went with
                    the journey as the journey went on the
                    senior monk could see some concern on
                    the junior monks mind he asked what was
                    wrong and the junior monk replied
                    how could you carry her like that you
                    know we can't touch women it's against
                    our way of life and the senior monk
                    answered I left the woman at the river's
                    edge long way back why are you still
                    carrying her the senior monk had broken
                    rules but for good reason once the
                    purpose was fulfilled he put her down
                    and continued on
                    he never gave it a further thought the
                    junior monk however he didn't touch the
                    woman but he had brought up the actions
                    of the senior monk when it was an action
                    of the past therefore the junior monk
                    was carrying the burden of what the
                    senior monk had done has an emotional
                    baggage,<br>
                     you see in life we have little
                    use for past experiences except of
                    learning whether it is good or bad and
                    just like in this Buddhist monk story we
                    need to let go of any burden the past
                    has placed on us it's happened it's over
                    it cannot be changed we can only move
                    forward and create a more compelling
                    future for ourselves
                    if you hang on to something which
                    happened in the past which gives you
                    suffering every time you relive it you
                    think about it you will get the same
                    suffering over and over again which will
                    create a cycle of suffering for yourself
                    so stop worrying and let the past go and
                    that way you can concentrate fully on
                    the future this is there to do
                    motivation stories thanks for watching
                    and stay blessed </p>
