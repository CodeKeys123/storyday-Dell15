                <p style="font-size: 40px; text-align: center;"> one day a woman lost her young son, just
                    a few days before her husband had died.
                    kisaku tommy was her name and now her
                    only son had died. she wasn't great to
                    despair naturally the child was her only
                    hope.
                    Buddha was staying in the town. people
                    said don't cry and don't weep why don't
                    you take the child to the Buddha?
                    he's so compassionate he may revive him
                    back to life. the woman rushed with the
                    dead body of the child. Buddha looked at
                    the woman and told her to put the child
                    in front of him and said to her yes I
                    will revive him but you will have to
                    fulfill one condition.
                    the woman said I am ready to give even
                    my life say any condition and I will
                    fulfill it. Buddha said it is a simple
                    condition I never make big requirements
                    of people only small requirements this
                    is a very simple thing just going to
                    town and bring a few mustard seeds. Just
                    remember one thing the mustard seeds
                    should come from a house where nobody
                    has ever died. The woman was in an insane
                    state. she could not see the point how
                    can you find a house where nobody has
                    ever died. she rushed with great hope and
                    she knew that every house had mustard
                    seeds because that was the only crop
                    that people were growing. The whole
                    village was growing it so there was no
                    problem. She knocked on many doors and
                    the people said a few mustard seeds we
                    can bring cart loads of mustard seeds
                    but we cannot fulfil the condition many
                    people have died in our house so our
                    mustard seeds won't do. When night dawned
                    the woman came to her senses she had
                    knocked on every door in the village
                    and slowly she saw that death is
                    inevitable, it happens to everybody that
                    nobody can escape from it
                    when she came back to Buddha she was a
                    totally different woman. Her child was
                    lying there and Buddha was waiting. He
                    said where are the mustard seeds? the
                    woman laughed fell down at his feet and
                    said initiate me into your path because
                    I have understood your message that
                    everybody has to die today my son has
                    died a few days before my husband died
                    and a few days afterwards I am going to
                    die. Before I die I want to see the
                    deathless. Now I am NOT interested in my
                    child being raised from the dead, I am
                    interested myself in seeing the eternal
                    life. Buddha said that was the purpose of
                    sending you so that you can be awakened
                    and he initiated kissa kutami.
                    <br> you see in
                    life or let's say there is no life
                    without death and there can't be death
                    without life we all have our own clocks
                    ticking and it may seem unfair why some
                    people die before others but it is just
                    the circle of life if there is no light
                    there can be no darkness if there is no
                    bad there can be any good and if there
                    is no death there can't be life
                    understanding this may seem beyond us
                    for we are attached emotionally to all
                    the people that we love and rightly so
                    life is a beautiful journey so enjoy
                    every second and minute together with
                    the people that you love
                    this is Dare to do motivation stories
                    thanks for watching and stay blessed
